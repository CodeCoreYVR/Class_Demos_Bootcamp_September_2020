-- [Lab] Selecting
-- Using data from this morning's lesson, write the following SQL Queries:

-- From the students table:

-- Select the first 10 students whose ages are between 35 and 45.
SELECT * FROM students WHERE age BETWEEN 35 AND 45;
-- Select the third set of 10 students whose ages are more than 25 and whose first names contain `le`. The students must be ordered by their id in ascending order then first name in a descending order.
SELECT * FROM students 
  WHERE age > 25 
  AND first_name LIKE '%le%' 
  ORDER BY id ASC, first_name DESC 
  LIMIT 10 
  OFFSET 20;
-- Select the 10 oldest students (You should ignore students with an age that is `NULL`).
SELECT * FROM students
  WHERE age IS NOT NULL 
  ORDER BY age DESC 
  LIMIT 10;
-- Select all students with age 45 whose last names contain the letter n.
SELECT * FROM students
  WHERE age = 45
  AND last_name ILIKE '%n%';


-- From the products table:

-- Select all the products that are on sale. (we will consider on price being a product whose sale_price is lower than the price)
SELECT * FROM products WHERE sale_price < price;

-- Select all the products that are on sale and have remaining items in stock ordered by the sale price in ascending order.
SELECT * FROM products 
  WHERE sale_price < price 
  AND remaining_quantity > 0 
  ORDER BY sale_price ASC;
-- Select all the products priced between 25 and 50 (regular price) and that are on sale.
SELECT * FROM products 
  WHERE sale_price < price 
  AND price BETWEEN 25 AND 50;
