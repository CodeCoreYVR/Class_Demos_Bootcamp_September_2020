// Varaibles

// use the let keyword with a name to declare a variable

let a;

// to assign a value to a variable use the assignment operator =

a = 1;

console.log(a); // prints 1

// you can do this all in one line

let b = 2;

console.log(b); // prints 2

b = 50; // so variables declared using let can be re-assinged

console.log(b); // prints 50;

// another way to declare a variable but you must assign a value to it at the same time (on the same line)
// const hello; // will give us an error

const hello = 'hello'; // this works

// hello = 50; // this will give us an error because variables declared with const can only be assigned once at declaration

// the old way of declaring variables in javascript is using `var`. It is basically the same as `let` but we don't use var anymore

var fruit = 'apples';
